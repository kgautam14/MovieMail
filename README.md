# MovieMail
Short Description:
A short fun program to send your friends the script of your choice of movie, word by word, one word per email. 


To run this program you can clone the MovieMail file and it contains the code: sendmail.py and all the text files for Movie Scipts based on their first letter in ZIp files. 

This code will run with Python3.0.

When the code asks you to input file name, you can either copy the file to the same directory as the code and simly type in the file name (include .txt) without apostrophes or you can simply copy the file path and paste it.

The Print Script option also shows you complete script and the number of words in the Script, so you get an insight of approximately how many emails you might send. 

The Send Email option would ask you for your own email*, password and your friend's email to whom you want to send the script. It will then after a final warning, send the complete script to your friend's email address one word per email. 

*Disclaimer: This program might affect your email id. Since for it to run, you need to change the security settings** for your email address. I would advice you to make a new email id for this preferrably with gmail. 

**Email ID Security Settings:
1. Go to Settings on your email account.
2. Select the Security option.
3. Turn 'ON' access to less secured apps.

PS: This is just for fun. Please don't trouble people.
